Numba can be used to compile Python code to run on GPUs.  This directory has
code samples to illustrate this.


## What is it?

1. `numba.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustrating how to use Numba to compile
    Python code to run on GPUs.  It illustrates the typical pitfalls for GPU
    programming (e.g., memory access patterns), and how to avoid them.
