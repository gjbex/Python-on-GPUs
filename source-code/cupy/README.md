# CuPy

CuPy serves as a "drop-in" replacement for numpy and (some) scipy with GPU support.


## What is it?

1. `environment.yml`: conda environment file specifying all dependencies
   required to run the code.
1. `cupy.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustrating how to use CuPy to perform
   computations on a GPU.
