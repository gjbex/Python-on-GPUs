# scikit-cuda

Scikit-cuda provides a Python interface to many linear algebra routines on the
GPU using CUDA. The interface is similar to that of
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and aims to provide simple and
efficient access to GPU operations for data science and scientific computing.

However, the library is aging, and has at least partially been superceded by
[CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org/), which provides a more general-purpose
interface to the CUDA API.
