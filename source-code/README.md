# Python on GPUs

Sample code for performing computations on a GPU.


## What is it?

1. `pycuda`: directory illustrating pyCUDA.
1. `scikit_cuda`: code illustrating linear algebra on a GPU device.  This is an
   older library and has been at least partially superceded by CuPy.
1. `numba`: code illustrating using numba for GPU computing.
1. `cupy`: Jupyter notebook illustrating some aspects of the `cupy` package.
